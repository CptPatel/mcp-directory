# Requirements Document - AI MCP Creator

## Introduction

The AI MCP Creator is the flagship feature that differentiates MCP Directory from competitors. It enables users to generate custom Model Context Protocol configurations using natural language descriptions, powered by OpenRouter's multi-model AI access. This feature democratizes MCP development by allowing non-technical users to create sophisticated MCPs through conversational AI.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Natural Language MCP Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to describe my desired MCP functionality in plain English, so that I can quickly create custom MCPs without writing code from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural language description THEN the system SHALL process the input through the selected AI model
2. WHEN the AI processes the description THEN the system SHALL generate valid MCP configuration code
3. WHEN the generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the generated code with syntax highlighting
4. IF the description is unclear or incomplete THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for clarification
5. WHEN the user provides additional context THEN the system SHALL refine the generated MCP accordingly

### Requirement 2: Multi-Model AI Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose from different AI models for MCP generation, so that I can select the best model for my specific use case and budget.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the AI Creator THEN the system SHALL display available AI models from OpenRouter
2. WHEN a user selects a model THEN the system SHALL use that model for generation
3. WHEN the selected model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to an alternative model
4. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with a different model automatically
5. WHEN a user exceeds their usage limits THEN the system SHALL display upgrade options

### Requirement 3: Interactive Code Preview and Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview and test my generated MCP in a safe environment, so that I can verify it works correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP code is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in a syntax-highlighted editor
2. WHEN a user clicks "Test MCP" THEN the system SHALL execute the MCP in a sandboxed environment
3. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL display test results and any errors
4. WHEN the MCP passes tests THEN the system SHALL enable the "Save" and "Add to Package" options
5. IF the MCP fails tests THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements through AI

### Requirement 4: Iterative Refinement Through AI Conversation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have a conversation with the AI to improve my MCP, so that I can iteratively refine it until it meets my exact needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides feedback on generated code THEN the system SHALL process it as a refinement request
2. WHEN refinement is requested THEN the system SHALL maintain context from previous generations
3. WHEN the AI suggests improvements THEN the system SHALL clearly highlight what changed
4. WHEN multiple iterations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain a version history
5. WHEN the user is satisfied THEN the system SHALL allow finalizing the MCP

### Requirement 5: Template Library and Pattern Recognition

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to leverage existing MCP patterns and templates, so that my generated MCPs follow best practices and proven patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating MCPs THEN the system SHALL use a curated template library
2. WHEN the AI recognizes common patterns THEN it SHALL suggest appropriate templates
3. WHEN templates are used THEN the system SHALL customize them based on user requirements
4. WHEN new successful patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL add them to the template library
5. WHEN users create popular MCPs THEN the system SHALL extract reusable patterns

### Requirement 6: Security and Code Quality Validation

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want all AI-generated MCPs to be automatically scanned for security issues and quality problems, so that users receive safe and reliable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP code is generated THEN the system SHALL run automated security scans
2. WHEN security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL block the MCP and suggest fixes
3. WHEN code quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide improvement suggestions
4. WHEN MCPs pass all checks THEN the system SHALL mark them as verified
5. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL flag for manual review

### Requirement 7: Usage Tracking and Billing Integration

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to track AI usage and implement tiered billing, so that the platform can be financially sustainable while providing value to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates an MCP THEN the system SHALL record the usage against their account
2. WHEN usage limits are approached THEN the system SHALL notify the user
3. WHEN limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL restrict access and show upgrade options
4. WHEN users upgrade their plan THEN the system SHALL immediately increase their limits
5. WHEN billing periods reset THEN the system SHALL reset usage counters

### Requirement 8: Integration with Package Builder

**User Story:** As a user, I want to seamlessly add my AI-generated MCPs to packages, so that I can combine custom and existing MCPs in my installations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP is successfully generated and tested THEN the system SHALL offer "Add to Package" option
2. WHEN "Add to Package" is clicked THEN the system SHALL add the MCP to the current package
3. WHEN the MCP is added THEN it SHALL appear in the package builder with proper metadata
4. WHEN packages are exported THEN AI-generated MCPs SHALL be included in installation scripts
5. WHEN sharing packages THEN AI-generated MCPs SHALL be properly attributed

### Requirement 9: Community Sharing and Discovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want to share my successful AI-generated MCPs with the community, so that others can benefit from my creations and I can discover what others have built.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP is finalized THEN the system SHALL offer publishing options
2. WHEN a user publishes an MCP THEN it SHALL appear in the community directory
3. WHEN MCPs are published THEN they SHALL include generation prompts and metadata
4. WHEN users browse the directory THEN they SHALL see AI-generated MCPs clearly marked
5. WHEN popular AI MCPs emerge THEN the system SHALL feature them prominently

### Requirement 10: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI MCP Creator to be fast and reliable, so that I can efficiently create MCPs without frustrating delays or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a generation request is made THEN the system SHALL respond within 30 seconds
2. WHEN the system is under high load THEN it SHALL queue requests and provide status updates
3. WHEN API failures occur THEN the system SHALL retry automatically with exponential backoff
4. WHEN multiple models fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and alternatives
5. WHEN the system is unavailable THEN it SHALL display maintenance status and estimated recovery time
