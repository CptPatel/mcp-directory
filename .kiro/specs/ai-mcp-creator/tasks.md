## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation for all core logic
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each task should result in working, testable functionality
- **Security First**: Security considerations integrated into every task, not added later
- **Performance Aware**: Performance implications considered in each implementation

### Dependencies and Sequencing
- Tasks 1-7 establish the backend foundation and can be developed in parallel
- Tasks 8-12 build the frontend interface and depend on backend completion
- Tasks 13-15 add integration and community features
- Tasks 16-20 focus on optimization, monitoring, and production readiness

### Quality Gates
Each task must meet these criteria before completion:
- All unit tests passing with >90% code coverage
- Integration tests validating expected behavior
- Security review completed for any user-facing functionality
- Performance benchmarks meeting design targets
- Code review completed by team member

### Risk Mitigation
- **AI Model Dependencies**: Implement robust fallback mechanisms early
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Security scanning integrated into every code generation task
- **Performance Issues**: Load testing and optimization built into each major component
- **User Experience**: Continuous user testing and feedback integration throughout development
