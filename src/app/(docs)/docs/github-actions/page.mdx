## Overview

GitHub Actions lets you ship Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers without leaving your repository. With a few YAML steps you can install dependencies, run tests, publish artifacts, and even deploy to platforms like Vercel or AWS Lambda.

This guide shows how to structure reusable workflows that:

- Validate MCP servers with linting, unit tests, and contract checks.
- Package MCP servers as npm packages, Docker images, or zip bundles.
- Deploy to hosting targets such as Vercel, AWS Lambda, or a remote VM.
- Report metrics back to the MCP Directory or your monitoring stack.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository that contains your MCP server implementation.
- Node.js 18+ or Python 3.9+ depending on the MCP runtime.
- Package registry tokens (npm, PyPI, Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry) when publishing artifacts.
- Deployment credentials for your target platform (Vercel token, AWS credentials, SSH key, etc.).
- GitHub Actions minutes or self-hosted runners with outbound network access.

## Quick Start Workflow

The following workflow installs dependencies, runs tests, and publishes an npm package when a release is created.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/mcp-release.yml
name: Publish MCP Server

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout source
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run MCP tests
        run: npm run test:mcp

      - name: Lint MCP protocol implementation
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Publish package
        run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}

      - name: Upload release artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: mcp-server-bundle
          path: dist/
```

## Deploying MCP Servers

### Deploy to Vercel

```yaml
- name: Deploy MCP edge functions
  uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
  with:
    vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
    vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
    vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
    working-directory: apps/mcp-edge
```

### Deploy to AWS Lambda

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    aws-region: us-east-1

- name: Package Lambda
  run: |
    npm run build
    zip -r lambda.zip dist/

- name: Deploy function
  run: |
    aws lambda update-function-code \
      --function-name mcp-server \
      --zip-file fileb://lambda.zip
```

### Deploy to Remote VM via SSH

```yaml
- name: Copy bundle to server
  uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}
    username: deploy
    key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}
    source: "dist/*"
    target: "/srv/mcp"

- name: Restart MCP service
  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}
    username: deploy
    key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}
    script: |
      sudo systemctl restart mcp-server
      systemctl status mcp-server --no-pager
```

## Secrets & Environment Management

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | Publish npm packages without exposing credentials. |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Deploy to Vercel programmatically. |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Deploy to AWS Lambda, ECS, or S3. |
| `SSH_KEY` | Push artifacts to your own VM or container host. |
| `MCP_API_KEY` | Authenticate with third-party MCP extensions. |

Use [environment protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-environments) to require approvals before production deployments.

## Workflow Recipes

### Matrix testing across runtimes

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    runtime: ["node@18", "node@20", "python@3.11"]
steps:
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    if: startsWith(matrix.runtime, 'node')
    with:
      node-version: ${{ matrix.runtime.split('@')[1] }}
  - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
    if: startsWith(matrix.runtime, 'python')
    with:
      python-version: ${{ matrix.runtime.split('@')[1] }}
```

### Automatic MCP catalog refresh

```yaml
- name: Download latest MCP catalog
  run: |
    curl -sS https://mcpdirectory.app/api/export > catalog.json

- name: Validate against schema
  run: npx ajv validate -s schema.json -d catalog.json
```

### Scheduled health checks

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 * * * *"

jobs:
  ping-mcp:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check MCP readiness
        run: |
          curl -sf https://your-mcp-host/health || exit 1
```

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

- Enable [job summaries](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-job-summary) to surface MCP metrics inside the Actions UI.
- Use `actions/upload-artifact` for log bundles, screenshots, or server dumps.
- Re-run jobs with `workflow_dispatch` to test hotfixes without tagging a release.
- Mirror workflows locally with [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) to debug environment differences.
- Add notifications (Slack, Teams, email) via reusable actions when a deployment fails.

### Common Failures

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `npm publish` fails with 403 | Ensure `NPM_TOKEN` has publish rights and the version is bumped. |
| `aws lambda update-function-code` fails | Check IAM permissions and the function name. |
| SSH deployment hangs | Enable `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` or pre-populate known hosts. |
| Workflow cannot find MCP config | Cache or commit the MCP configuration file and reference it via `${{ github.workspace }}`. |

## Best Practices

- **Use reusable workflows** for shared MCP build logic across multiple repositories.
- **Cache dependencies** with `actions/cache` or language-specific setup actions to speed up builds.
- **Tag artifacts** with MCP version numbers so rollbacks are easy.
- **Add smoke tests** after deployment to verify the MCP handshake succeeds.
- **Document workflows** in `/docs` so contributors understand the release pipeline.

## FAQ

### How do I keep MCP credentials safe in GitHub Actions?

Store API keys and tokens in GitHub Secrets, scope deployment credentials to the minimal permissions required, and restrict environment access with required reviewers.

### Can a single workflow deploy multiple MCP servers?

Yes. Use matrix jobs or sequential steps to build and deploy multiple MCP packages within the same workflow. Keep outputs clearly named so downstream jobs can consume them.

### How do I debug failed MCP jobs in Actions?

Upload artifacts, enable verbose logging on your MCP commands, and run the workflow locally with `act` to reproduce issues. Consider adding temporary `sleep` or diagnostic steps when investigating flaky behaviour.
