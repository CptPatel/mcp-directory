    a: "Most MCP servers need persistent processes. Use Edge Functions or background jobs, set proper memory limits, and ensure the handler returns responses quickly."

## Overview

Containerising MCP servers or running them on Vercel’s serverless platform offers convenient deployment, but misconfiguration can produce cold-start failures, timeouts, or missing environment variables. This guide covers the most frequent issues and their fixes.

## Docker Deployment Checklist

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev
COPY . .
ENV PORT=8000
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

1. **Ensure dependencies install** (check network access, private registries).
2. **Expose the MCP port** and map it when running: `docker run -p 8000:8000 mcp-server`.
3. **Set env vars** through `--env-file` or your orchestrator.
4. **Health checks**: add `/health` endpoint and configure Docker or Kubernetes readiness probes.

## Vercel Deployment Checklist

- Only lightweight MCP handlers work well in Edge Functions. For long-running tasks, use Vercel cron jobs or background functions.
- Configure `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/mcp.ts": {
      "memory": 1024,
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```

- Set environment variables for each environment (Preview, Production).
- Use `next.config.js` to mark MCP routes as dynamic: `export const runtime = "edge";` when appropriate.

## Debugging Techniques

### Docker

```bash
# View logs
docker logs mcp-server

# Attach shell
docker exec -it mcp-server /bin/sh

# Inspect network
docker inspect mcp-server --format '{{json .NetworkSettings.Ports}}'
```

### Vercel

- Inspect deployment logs in the Vercel dashboard.
- Run `vercel env pull .env.local` to keep local env vars in sync.
- Use `vercel logs <deployment-url>` for realtime output.

## Common Error Matrix

| Symptom | Docker Fix | Vercel Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` | Rebuild image after adding files to `COPY`. | Verify `vercel build` uses the correct entry point. |
| Timeout | Increase `--timeout` or optimize queries. | Move heavy work to background job. |
| `PORT` already in use | Change host port mapping or use `--init`. | Let Vercel manage the port; remove hard-coded values. |
| Environment variable missing | Pass via `docker run --env`. | Set in Vercel dashboard and redeploy. |

## Logging & Monitoring

- Ship container logs to CloudWatch, Datadog, or Logflare.
- Enable OpenTelemetry (OTLP) exporters inside the MCP server for traces.
- Tag logs with deployment version and commit SHA for traceability.

## FAQ

### Why does my MCP crash on Vercel?

Ensure the MCP handler finishes within the max duration and uses supported APIs. For long-running servers, deploy to a container or background worker instead.

### How do I debug a failing Docker container?

Use `docker logs`, inspect the container with `docker exec`, and verify environment variables, network ports, and filesystem paths.

### Can I share the same Docker image across staging and production?

Yes—tag the image once, then supply environment-specific configuration via secrets or environment variables.
