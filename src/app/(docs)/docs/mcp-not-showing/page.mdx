## Overview

Claude Desktop automatically detects MCP servers defined in its configuration folder. If your server is missing from the MCP panel, follow this checklist for macOS and Windows to restore visibility.

## Verify Configuration Paths

| OS | Config Path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/mcp/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\mcp\` |
| Linux | `~/.config/claude/mcp/` |

Each MCP has a JSON or YAML manifest describing the command to run.

```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/mcp-filesystem",
      "args": ["--root", "~/Projects"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Checklist

1. **Confirm the manifest exists** in the correct directory.
2. **Validate JSON/YAML syntax** with `jq` or `yamllint`.
3. **Ensure the command path is executable** (`chmod +x` on macOS/Linux).
4. **Check port conflicts** if the MCP binds to a TCP port.
5. **Restart Claude Desktop** after changes.

## macOS Specific Fixes

```bash
# Grant execute permission
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mcp-filesystem

# Allow network access in macOS firewall
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/local/bin/mcp-filesystem
```

- If the MCP binary is quarantined (`com.apple.quarantine` attribute), remove it with `xattr -d`.
- Use Activity Monitor to confirm the MCP process starts when Claude Desktop launches it.

## Windows Specific Fixes

```powershell
# Unblock downloaded binaries
Unblock-File "C:\\mcp\\server.exe"

# Allow through Windows Defender
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="MCP Server" dir=in action=allow program="C:\\mcp\\server.exe" enable=yes
```

- Run Claude Desktop as administrator if the MCP requires elevated filesystem access.
- Ensure the manifest uses Windows paths (`C:\\path\\to\\server.exe`).

## Logs & Diagnostics

- Open Claude Desktop > Settings > MCP > "View Logs" to inspect startup failures.
- Check the MCP server logs for stack traces or permission errors.
- Use the MCP Inspector tooling to run a handshake manually and verify capabilities.

## FAQ

### Where does Claude Desktop read MCP configurations from?

macOS uses `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/mcp/`, Windows uses `%APPDATA%\Claude\mcp\`, and Linux uses `~/.config/claude/mcp/`.

### Do I need to restart Claude Desktop after editing MCP configs?

Yes. Restart or use the "Reload MCPs" control to refresh the manifest.

### Why does the MCP appear but return errors?

The server may lack permissions, fail to start, or bind to a blocked port. Inspect logs and apply the fixes above.
